## FRONTEND EXERCISE 1

### ADAMS your new CTO requires an urgent need for you to quickly layout a sample template for a client interested in a fintech software.
### You as an experience developer in the company is contacted as this is urgent owing to the fact that the ui/ux in a team of 3 is unavailable to quickly sketch out a figma sample for you to follow through its front end ui sample implementation. Other team mates are preety preoccupied with other projects.

#Task
# Come up with a generic sample design homepage that show cases the feature of the client need. You are not expected to implement any logic . You are just in for the design of a landing page and possible a dashboard if necessary.

## Good luck.
